Academic papers are publications that only written for academic audience.

The language and the way the subject is told are pretty heavy even for professionals to understand and use the presented information.

Because of this, [the average read number of an academic paper is 10 and, half of the academic publications are not read at all](https://www.chronicle.com/article/can-it-really-be-true-that-half-of-academic-papers-are-never-read/){:target="_blank"}.[^1]

What do I believe is that the information should flow from person to person without any clog of heavy language and expression.

For this purpose, I started this publication to be a platform where academics and others can write the ideas in academic papers in a language that can be understood by the public.

#### How people understand best?

The best way for people to understand a subject is to learn the more basic related subjects to the main subject.

Basically, imagine that you try to tell what you have done to a 5th grade student. When you try to explain your researches and ideas in the academic papers, it is better to create a tree of related subjects first.

After you create the subject tree, you need to explain each node and edge in the tree, which means explaining each subject and relations between them.

#### What is the benefit of academicians out of this project?

Your works will be understood faster and easier, which will help your papers to be cited more.

I hope this project grows and we increase the flow of information. Because, the flow of information increases the use of information. We, humanity, can develop faster, focus on more important things and make the science our social media. I do not plan to make money from this. I just want this connection between academics and public to be created, that’s all.
