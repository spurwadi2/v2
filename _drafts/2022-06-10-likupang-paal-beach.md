Tidak dapat di pungkiri, travelling menjadi salah satu kebutuhan sekunder masyarakat yang harus dipenuhi. Rutinitas sehari-hari membuat pikiran kita penat, dan travelling bisa membantu kita untuk mengistirahatkan pikiran kita sejenak. Pernah dengar dong istilah ‘Work-life balance’? Suatu kondisi dimana kita bisa menyeimbangkan antara pekerjaan, kehidupan keluarga, kehidupan pribadi dan rekreasi.

Banyak riset yang mengatakan bahwa jika ‘Work-Life Balance’ itu benar-benar di jalankan, kehidupan seseorang itu akan lebih produktif, lebih kreatif, dan lebih bahagia. Karena itu rekreasi seperti travelling di butuhkan untuk kesehatan pikiran dan mental kita, apalagi setelah satu dunia di terpa oleh badai pandemi seperti waktu kemarin.

Banyak orang berpikir rekreasi seperti travelling itu harus jauh dan mahal, harus keluar negri baru merasa pergi travelling. Padahal travelling di dalam negri juga seru loh! Pasti banyak kota atau tempat yang pasti belum pernah kita kunjungi, dan banyak hal dan tradisi yang belum kita ketahui. Bagaimana tidak? Indonesia punya lebih dari 16 ribu pulau dan hampir 100 kota. Gak kebayang butuh waktu berapa lama jika ingin mengelilingi Indonesia saja.

Perjalan road trip kami membutuhkan waktu 4-5 hari.

Stunning, Stunning, Stunning.. Guess that’s all I can say for this beautiful Pantai Paal

Always! Nature never fails me. It is always breathtaking, and it always remind me to its Creator.

And today i want to share to you this awesome place that captured my heart. Located at northwestern side of Slovenia,

=====

My jaw literally dropped when I saw the perfect shades of blue right in front of my eyes. Never in my life i saw such an extended beauty in the land I called my home, Indonesia.

Just dont forget to bring your own cute swim wear, snorkelling gears, and put a lot of sun-blocks if you dont want to get sun-burnt like me (since there’s no shelter at all),  or tanning lotion if you want to come back with a hot tanned skin.

All i can say is, this is worth the visit if you’re travelling to Croatia. Plitvice Lakes National Park might be one of your unforgettable place. Probably the only advise from me is to bring your own drink and pee before you go in, cause you’ll have a hard time to find a cafe / vending machine and a toilet. haha

I guess nuff said. Enjoy the beautiful pictures below, everyone!

> There is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean never stop kissing the shore line, no matter how many times it is sent away~

We humans have lost the wisdom of genuinely resting and relaxing. We worry too much. We don’t allow our bodies to heal, and we don’t allow our minds and hearts to heal.

I have to agree to the above saying that sometimes we just forget how to relax. We tend to do things fast, want it all, and tend to burden ourselves with some unimportant things that makes us forget to rest. Little that we know that with a proper rest, it can refreshes your mind and soul, and you might have done things better right after having a great laugh with your friends and a sound sleep. Who’s agree with me?

Indonesia is lucky enough to host some of the most beautiful beaches to exist.

One of them is Paal Beach, a gorgeous stretch of white sand and clear blue water laying peacefully on the eastern edge of Likupang, North Sulawesi

Paal Beach is one of the best beaches in North Sulawesi that you have to see.

As a diamond of North Sulawesi, white-sanded heaven, and clear watered paradise are just a few names to call the magnificent Paal Beach. Unquestionably, tourists are drawn to its stunning charm without even trying.

Although the beach is considered newly developed, you don’t need to worry about any lack of facilities. You can rent a gazebo to hang out and enjoy the view comfortably. Other than that, public restrooms are also available.

A cozy coastal destination that it is, Paal Beach will without a doubt send you home with exceptional memories to remember for a lifetime.

Around 1 hour from Manado in Marinsow Village is Paal Beach. This beach is extremely popular with local families on the weekend so come in the week or arrive early on Saturday or Sunday.

It’s no wonder they love it so much though as it is an absolutely gorgeous stretch of pink-gold sand.

Set against rolling green hills, the turquoise water sparkles, and your feet sink in the fine sand.

The waves are usually quite calm and there are water sports available. At certain times of the year it can get quite choppy though so check the conditions before you make the trip.
